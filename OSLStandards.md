# OSL Standards #

You will need open, short and load standards to calibrate your VNA. There are good instructions for building your own [here](http://blog.kotarak.net/2009/10/n2pk-vna-calibration-standards.html) and [here](http://www.dxatlas.com/rocky/Files/Rocky_VNA_v1c.pdf).

Following what was done [here](http://blog.kotarak.net/2009/10/n2pk-vna-calibration-standards.html), I bought and modified "BNC Female PCB Mount Connectors" from eBay. My load standard is 60.5 Ohms and is created from two 121 Ohm 1% surface mount resistors in parallel. I did try to have the same reference plane for all standards. I also built a known standard using a 470 pF silver mica capacitor in series with 121 Ohm resistor for testing. My standards are shown below.
